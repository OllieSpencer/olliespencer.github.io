        <p>
          I’m a hopeful writer who particularly enjoys crafting screenplays and
          exploring my experiences/what’s in front of me through creative
          non-fiction. I’ve previously focused on journalism but have lapsed in
          favour of creative pursuits. Before transferring into the Creative
          Writing major at RMIT I completed their Advanced Diploma of
          Professional Screenwriting. I’ve grown up here in Melbourne surrounded
          by a lot of artists, writers, musicians, graffiti writers,
          skateboarders and other degenerates who have hugely influenced me and
          what I focus on in my writing. Going forward I’d like to explore urban
          decay and industrialisation through both writing and photography,
          while now I’m milking everything I can out of my adventures across the
          country on freight trains.
